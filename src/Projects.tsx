        "This wedding invitation website was crafted with a focus on elegance and simplicity to ensure a delightful user experience. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it features smooth animations powered by AOS (Animate On Scroll). To manage guest RSVPs, a Firebase backend stores and organizes responses efficiently. The site includes a custom-designed photo gallery, a countdown timer to the big day, and personalized sections for the coupleâ€™s story, event details, and venue map integration using Google Maps API. The entire project is optimized for mobile, providing easy navigation for all invited guests.",

This Project features dynamic routing, state management, and showing data based on API calls. The layout is obviously based on the Spotify Web Player. This was one of my first projects so it has some flaws, for example it not being responsive.",
